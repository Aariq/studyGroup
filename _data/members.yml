    I build software and infrastructure for researchers. I create software for fun. I like to talk about software. I don't understand what "work-life balance" means. I <em>do</em> like to ride motorcycles and go hiking. Gryffindor.

    I'm a postdoc from Computer Science, studying how people think about, reshape, and visualize data. I build web-based tools to make these processes less painful, and more accessible to more diverse data workers. Slytherin.

    As the UA Libraries Data Science Specialist, I agitate and advocate for campus data and computational literacy. I work mostly in R and retain a modicum of phylogenetics theory. As a graduate student, I chased butterflies and learned Java.
