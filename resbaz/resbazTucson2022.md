## What

The Research Bazaar is a worldwide festival promoting the digital literacy emerging at the center of modern research. Throughout 2022, events are happening at university campuses around the globe.

ResBaz Tucson is a free, multi-day intensive conference where researchers come together to up-skill in "next generation digital research tools and skills." In the spirit of a marketplace or bazaar, ResBaz is a highly participatory event where researchers from many different disciplines can learn, share knowledge and skills, and have fun!
